Overview

In this learn about one of the strengths of FEM, the use of unstructured meshes. In FEM it is fairly easy to use unstructured meshes and elements of differing shapes (e.g. quads vs triangles) to mesh complex geometries. In this session we will use a so-called mesh generator, a piece of software that meshes a geometry and returns the nodal coordinates and element connectivity, and explore which changes in the code are necessary to replace our quad elements with triangular elements.
