Overview
============================================

So far, we have learned how to solve partial differential equations using the Finite Differences Method (FDM). :cite:`Briggs2000` in their book “A Multigrid Tutorial” describe this as *“…finite differences methods replace the problem domain by a grid and produce a vector whose components are approximations to the solution at the grid points”*. This is straightforward and exactly what we have done in the past weeks. Here is what they have to say on finite elements: *“…finite element methods partition the problem domain into subregions and produce a simple function in each subregion that approximates the solution”*. This seems a bit less straightforward but results in a very powerful method to solve partial differential equations.

In this lecture, we will start out by having a closer look at finding approximate solutions for partial differential equations before diving deeper into finite element methods. A powerful technique, which is close to the finite element concept, is the *Method of Weighted Residuals* (MWR). This method will be presented as an introduction, before using a particular subclass of MWR, the Galerkin Method of Weighted Residuals, to derive the  equations of the Finite Element Method (FEM).
