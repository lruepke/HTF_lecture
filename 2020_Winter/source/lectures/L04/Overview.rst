Lecture overview
================

During this lecture we will investigate how fluid properties, given by the pure water equation-of-state, affect flow dynamics and vent temperatures. We will use python scripts to plot and analyze the thermodynamic properties of pure water amd will make 2D convection experiments for assessing how those properties affect upflow temperatures.
