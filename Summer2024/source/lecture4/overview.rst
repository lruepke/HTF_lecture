Overview
===========================

In this session we will progress to 2-D. This involves learning about:

    * 2-D shape functions
    * isoparametic elements
    * local vs global coordinates
    * numerical integration
    * 2-D matrix assembly

In the end, we will have a working 2-D code that includes all the major components of a typical FEM code. This code will also be the basis for working with unstructured meshes in the next sessions.
