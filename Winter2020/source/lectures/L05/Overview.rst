Lecture overview
================

After having studied how the thermodynamic properties of water control the dynamics of submarine hydrothermal systems, we will now have a closer lock on structural controls and explore how permeability variations affect flow. For this we will first look into synthetic cases, before considering fault-controlled vent system at slow-spreading ridges such as TAG, Logatchev, and Lonqi.

The goal of the lecture is to understand how permeability controls hydrothermal flow and how we can setup complicated geometries and permeability distributions in OpenFoam.
