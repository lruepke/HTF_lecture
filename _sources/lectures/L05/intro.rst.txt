Structural controls on hydrothermal flow
=====================================================

Hydrothermal systems on slow-spreading ridges differe to their counterparts on fast-spreading ridges, in that they are often associated with tectonic faults (:numref:`fig:mar_vent_fig` ).

It remains a questions of ongoing research how exactly tectonic faults affect hydrothermal flow. It is, however likely, that the permeability of faults is different, most likely higher. One popular model is therefore that major tectonic faults, such as detachment faults, channelize hot hydrothermal upflow towards an off-axis vent site. This conceptual model was for example presented for the TAG :cite:`deMartin2007` and Logatchev :cite:`andersen2015` vent fiels on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR).


:numref:`fig:mar_vent_fig`  shows micro-seismicity and p-wave speeds for the TAG segment undergoing detachment faulting. One plausible scenario is that a magmatic intrusion at depth is driving hydrothermal flow and that upflow is channalized along a low-angle detachment fault. Venting occurs at the TAG mount, located on the hanging wall of the detachment.
