Excercise 1
===========

We have prepared jupyter notebooks that let's you explore the thermodynamic properties of pure water. Play with them!

.. figure:: /_figures/Properties_Water.*
   :align: center
   :name: fig:Properties_Water

   Water properties as a function of temperature and pressure, using python package of iapws_. Properties calculation details can be found in the :ref:`/lectures/L04/cases/Jupp_Schultz/jupyter/Plot_Lectures.ipynb#Properties-as-function-of-temperature` in the notebook.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    cases/Jupp_Schultz/jupyter/Plot_Lectures.ipynb

Try to get these notebooks to work and play a little bit with them. Explore how the values change under different P-T conditions and change the line plot to also show enthalpy. One way of doing this is to create a new notebook and to copy the code from above into them

.. code-block:: bash 

   code plot_iapws_class.ipynb
