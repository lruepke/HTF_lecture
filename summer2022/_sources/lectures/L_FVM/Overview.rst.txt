Lecture overview
================

After having studied how to use OpenFOAM to solve hydrothermal problems, 
we will now have a deeper look at how FVM and OpenFOAM solver works.
For this we will look into the basic heat diffusion solver named :code:`laplacianFoam` what we used in the first lecture :ref:`L01_FirstCase`.
